      "description": "For example, say we have a file like:\n   message Foo {\n     optional string foo = 1;\n   }\n Let's look at just the field definition:\n   optional string foo = 1;\n   ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^\n   a       bc     de  f  ghi\n We have the following locations:\n   span   path               represents\n   [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.\n   [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).\n   [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).\n   [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).\n   [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).\n\n Notes:\n - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any\n   particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are\n   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire\n   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will\n   have an outer location whose path refers to the \"extensions\" repeated\n   field without an index.\n - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single\n   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most\n   obvious example is the \"extend\" block again -- there may be multiple\n   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.\n - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For\n   example, the \"extendee\" of an extension declaration appears at the\n   beginning of the \"extend\" block and is shared by all extensions within\n   the block.\n - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span\n   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a \"group\" defines\n   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations\n   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.\n - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to\n   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could\n   be recorded in the future.",
